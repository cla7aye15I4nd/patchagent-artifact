**IMPORTANT**: All test cases can be compiled and triggered using `skyset_tools/asan{++/cc}` in the Docker container specified in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`. However, we cannot guarantee success if you change the compiler or Docker configuration.

## Dataset Structure

```
{PROJECT NAME}
    - build.sh 
    - {VULNERABILITY-TAG}
      - @POC@
      - exp.sh
      - config.yml
      - report.txt
      - patch.diff
```

The `build.sh` script should be executed within the project directory. It can accept `CC` and `CXX` as environment variables. The `exp.sh` script takes `@POC@` as input to execute the program. The `report.txt` file displays the address sanitizer report. The `patch.diff` serves as the ground truth patch.

A example of `config.yml`:
```yaml
fix_commit: b8ff98c810f1bf8e8000f44be2f4af30a7ba43fa
fix_date: '2024-02-05'
project: wasm-micro-runtime
sanitizer: AddressSanitizer
tag: 06df58f-null_pointer_deref
```
